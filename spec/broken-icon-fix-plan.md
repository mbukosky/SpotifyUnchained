# Fix Broken Ko-fi Icon Plan

## Problem Analysis
The broken icon is located in `/src/app/header/header.component.html` at lines 5-7. It's a "Buy Me a Coffee" ko-fi icon that uses an external image URL (`https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi2.png?v=b`) that is no longer accessible.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update to Official Ko-fi Button (Recommended)
- Replace the broken external image URL with the current official Ko-fi button image
- Use the current Ko-fi CDN URL: `https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3`

### Option 2: Remove the Ko-fi Button
- Remove the entire ko-fi donation section if no longer needed

### Option 3: Add Local Asset
- Download the ko-fi icon and store it locally in the assets folder
- Update the image source to point to the local asset

## Implementation Steps (Option 1 - Recommended)
1. Update the image `src` attribute in `header.component.html` line 6
2. Change from: `https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi2.png?v=b`
3. Change to: `https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3`
4. Test the fix by running the development server

## Files to Modify
- `/src/app/header/header.component.html` (line 6)

This is a simple one-line fix that should resolve the broken icon issue immediately.

## Implementation Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Updated the ko-fi icon URL in header component from broken URL to current official Ko-fi CDN URL.
